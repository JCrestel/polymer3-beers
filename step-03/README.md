# ![](/img/logo-25px.png) Polymer Beers - Polymer tutorial - Step 03

In this step we are going to create a more complex Polymer element, a custom `beer-list`.
This element will use a JavaScript array as model and automatically generate a `beer-list-item` for each beer in the array.


## Creating the element file

We begin by creating a new file for the element, `elements/beer-list.js`. Inside it we put a basic Polymer element definition:


```js
import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js';

// We are going to use `beer-list-item`, so we import it
import './beer-list-item.js';

export class BeerLits extends PolymerElement {

    static get template() {
      return html`
      `;
    }
  
    static get properties() {
      return {
      }
    }
  
  }
  
  customElements.define('beer-list', BeerList);
```


## Defining the model

We are going to model our (ever growing) beer collection as a JavaScript array in our `beer-list` element.
We will use the element's `constructor`, that is often used to initialize variables.

```js
export class BeerLis extends PolymerElement {

  static get template() {
    return html`
      `;
  }

  static get properties() {
    return {
      beers: {
        type: Array,
      },
    }
  }

  constructor() {
    super();

    this.beers = [
      {
        alcohol: 8.5,
        name: "Affligem Tripel",
        description: "The king of the abbey beers. It is amber-gold and pours with a deep head and original aroma, delivering a complex, full bodied flavour. Pure enjoyment! Secondary fermentation in the bottle."
      },
      {
        alcohol: 9.2,
        name: "Rochefort 8",
        description: "A dry but rich flavoured beer with complex fruity and spicy flavours."
      },
      {
        alcohol: 7,
        name: "Chimay Rouge",
        description: "This Trappist beer possesses a beautiful coppery colour that makes it particularly attractive. Topped with a creamy head, it gives off a slight fruity apricot smell from the fermentation. The aroma felt in the mouth is a balance confirming the fruit nuances revealed to the sense of smell. This traditional Belgian beer is best savoured at cellar temperature "
      }
    ];
  }
}
```


So now we have a `beers` property in our element, that can be access in the JS side using `this.beers` and in the `template` side using  `[[beers]]`.

As you can see, for each beer we have the `name` and `description` properties that `beer-list-item` needs, and also added an `alcohol` property that our element isn't capable to use yet.


## Data-binding

A reasonable thing to do for our `beer-list` would be to spawn a `beer-list-element` for each beer in the `beers` array. How can we do that? By using Polymer's [data binding helper element](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/templates.html), concretely a template repeater (`dom-repeat`).

In order to use `dom-repeat` you need to import it:

```js
// Import template repeater
import '@polymer/polymer/lib/elements/dom-repeat.js';
```

And then you can use it in the element template:

```js
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <style>
        /* CSS rules for your element */
      </style>
      <div class="beers">
        <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{beers}}">
          <beer-list-item name="{{item.name}}" description="{{item.description}}">
          </beer-list-item>
        </template>
      </div>
    `;
```

The template repeater is a specialized template that binds to an array. It creates one instance of the templateâ€™s contents for each item in the array. It adds two properties to the binding scope for each instance:

- `item`: The array item used to create this instance
- `index`: The index of item in the array

For more information about the template repeater, see the [Polymer documentation](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/templates#dom-repeat).


## Using the new element

In the `index.html` file we aren't going to use directly `beer-list-item` elements anymore, but a simple `beer-list`.
Let's replace the import of `beer-list-item` by an import of `beer-list`:

```html
<!-- Import `beer-list` element -->
  <script type="module" src="./elements/beer-list.js"></script>
```

And use it in the body:

```html
  <beer-list></beer-list>
```

## Let's add some Bootstrap

We can now use [`granite-bootstrap`](https://github.com/lostinbrittany/granite-bootstrap) to add Bootstrap look and feel
to your component.

You begin  by importing `granite-bootstrap`:

```js
import '@granite-elements/granite-bootstrap/granite-bootstrap.js';
```

and then, inside your component, use granite-bootstrap as shared style:

```js
  static get template() {
    return html`
      <style include="granite-bootstrap"></style>
      <div class="beers container">
        <template is="dom-repeat" items="{{beers}}">
          <beer-list-item name="{{item.name}}" description="{{item.description}}">
          </beer-list-item>
        </template>
      </div>
    `;
  }
```

So no the beers are rendered inside a Bootstrap [container](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/#containers) element, as you can see with the margins.

## Aditionnal experiments

### Make the `beer-list` element show the number of beers in the list.

In the element's `template` you have access to the beers variable, you can then get it's size and show it after the beers:

```html
<div>Number of beers in list: [[beers.length]]</div>
```

### Play with `dom-repeat`

Create a repeater in `beer-list` that constructs a simple table:

```html
<table>
  <tr><th>Row number</th></tr>
  <template is="dom-repeat" items="[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]">
    <tr><td>{{item}}</td></tr>
  </template>
</table>
```

Extra points: try and make an 8x8 table using an additional `dom-repeat`.

*Note: To access properties from nested `dom-repeat` templates, use the `as` attribute to assign a different name for the item property. Use the `index-as` attribute to assign a different name for the `index` property.*
